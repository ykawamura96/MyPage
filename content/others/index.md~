## Flute Robot (2012 ~ 2013)

{{< figure src="/highschool/00.png"  class="center" width="320"  >}}

I created flute playing robot when I was an highschool student.

The project including mechanical design, circuit board design, and software design were done all by myself.

It was good memory of me to visited Akihabara(秋葉原) so often to buy some electric parts.
